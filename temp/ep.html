<p> <b>ePlanet: commercializing computer vision</b>
<p>
ePlanet was a company founded in 1997 by John Levy, Meg Withgott,
and myself. We were a spinoff of
<A target="_blank" href="http://www.interval.com"> Interval Research </a> with the
goal of productizing computer vision based entertainment
products for home consumers.

<p> <b>Computer vision??</b> Computer vision is the science of getting computers to <em>see</em>.
In the same way that speech recognition enables computers to understand
words spoken into a microphone, computer vision enables computers
to understand images taken by a digital camera. It is an
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/cil/ftp/html/vision.html">active academic area of research</a>
with amazing long term potential. However there are almost no computer vision products.

<p><b>Technology</b> At ePlanet we developed a series of real time computer
vision based products. Our technology was capable of tracking
people (body, head location, and arms) at over 30 frames per
second using a standard USB webcam and PC. In addition, we were able
to create some spectacular "Virtual Blue Screen" technology for inserting
people into virtual scenes in real time. These features were immensely popular
with kids, who love to see themselves on the screen, and love physical
imaginative play.


<p><b>Products</b> In August of 1999 the company successfully
shipped the first computer vision product for home consumers.
Published and distributed by Mattel and Intel, the <a target="_blank"
href="me2cam1_files/index.htm">IntelPlay Me2Cam(TM)</a> has since
received some rave reviews. In February, 2000 it won the
prestigious <a target="_blank" href="Bologna/BolognaPrize.html">
Bologna 2000 New Media Prize for the Most Innovative Children's Software Product</a>.
As they said,
"it is one of the few software products out there which get children up off their
seats and using their muscles". This was precisely our goal.

<p>
In September of 1999, after almost 3 years of operation, the company
was forced to shut down.
Due to a lack of VC funding (we were not an Internet company, and
pretty early for the market) we had to close our doors.
I'm proud of what we accomplished at ePlanet. In the process
however I also learned some valuable lessons, and moved on.
